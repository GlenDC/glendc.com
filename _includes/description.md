Glen is a young programmer who loves challenges and is always willing to learn and improve. Learning to work with computer hardware/software and playing videogames from a very early age on, made him the person he is today. Open source, free education and a global world are key values he stands for. Feel to [contact me](mailto:{{ site.email }}) with questions and interesting proposals.
