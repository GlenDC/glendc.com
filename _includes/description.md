I'm a young programmer who loves challenges and am always willing to learn and improve. Learning to work with computer hardware/software and playing videogames from a very early age on, made me the person I am today. Open source, free education and a global world are what I stand for. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:{{ site.email }}) for questions and proposals.
