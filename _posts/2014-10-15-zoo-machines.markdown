In 2011, on a rainy weekend, I fell in love, which changed my life changed forever.

Like most of you know, games were always in one way or another involved in my life. Which eventually also made me go to Howest, to study Digital Arts and Entertainment. It's there that I found  the true programmer deep within myself. Or at least, starting to go on some serious dates with him.

Early second year of my education I got the change, with a couple of other students of my education to participate in the Art Gamejam #3 contest in Tourcoing. A game jam?! I had never heard of that before but I certainly was intrigued about the fact that they expect you to make a "game" in 48 hours. Hell, I didn't even believe that was possible.

In the end the event turned out to become one of the most amazing experiences of my life (#overdramaticmuch). If you want to read more about what I thought back then, feel free to read [this article](http://glendc.com/2012/11/19/artgame/), which I wrote a week after that event. Now I know that it actually had serious impact on how I would pursuit life from than on. It made me more professional and it turned out, that it was the first of [many events like this](http://glendc.com/resume/#game-jams-and-hackatons).

> That weekend I fell in love. Not only with the programmer inside me, but also with the first girlfriend in my life, funny enough, also a programmer.

Now, 2 years later, the organisation invited me to come over and participate in the awesome event, once again. For that, and the fact that they pay all my expenses, I would like to thank them. It certainly will be a great experience, with a lot of hacking and the opportunity to meet amazing people (from different generations). Looking forward to the weekend of the 7th of November.
