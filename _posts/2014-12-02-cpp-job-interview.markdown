> Job interviews, a source of tears and nervous breakdowns. In this interview weâ€™ll turn that stress into energy by preparing you as good as possible with as goal to nail your interview and get the job.

This is the introduction of my recent article published at [https://www.airpair.com/c++/posts/preparing-for-cpp-interview](https://www.airpair.com/c++/posts/preparing-for-cpp-interview). The goal of this post is to share my experiences with job interviews as a C++ programmer and help you to prepare for it.

I enjoy writing articles and I love programming even more. Opportunities such as these make me therefore very happy. I hope you find the article insightful and I would love to hear your feedback. Together with Airpair there will be a Q&A hangout hosted where you have the change to ask a question you may have, regarding this article and its content. The date for that stream will be announced soon on their twitter account.
