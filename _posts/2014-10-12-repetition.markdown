After being more practical focused for a "long" time (_AKA_ doing big projects), I've made the switch again to becoming more educational focused, at least in my free time. Having made this shift feels good. As a programmer your knowledge, experience and capabilities are just as well your limitations. MOOC's and the related additional research that comes with it, makes me feel, that my horizon and capabilities are expanding on a satisfying rate, every day.

By not doing any more big projects on my own, there is a lot of time extra, certainly enough for some proper open source work. This week I'll start my introduction phase to the gnu community and the gcc code base. Can't wait to submit my first fix to one of the maintainers! Feels quite nice to becoming more and more soaked into the GNU/Linux Eco-system.

Oh, and why are there so many possible C++ interview questions? Certainly makes you realise how vast and complex the language is, if that wasn't clear enough already.
