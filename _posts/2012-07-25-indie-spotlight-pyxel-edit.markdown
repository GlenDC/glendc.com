_Indie, short for independent, teams can make epic products. Advertisement however, is something they can't offer, so often they stray in the dark. This is not only sad for its creators, but also for its potential users, whom remain unknown. That's why I devote this series to the indie applications and give them a chance to shine in the spotlights as it is supposed to be._

Our first star and opener of this series is **Pyxel Edit**, developed by [Daniel Kvarfordt](http://danikgames.com/). The reason why I choose this application is simple. Regularly I think about applications which many people could use, but don't exist yet. One of those applications on a long list of ideas is a pixel editor, which enables you to create pixel art in a user-friendly, yet powerful way. A question you could ask yourself is: "_Why not just make pixel art in existing applications like photoshop or illustrator?_". The answer to that proposition is as simple as the main application idea. Classic illustration applications aren't made to create pixel art. Using them to create Pixel art translates into a slow workflow, which is exactly the reason why many big developers have their own toolsets to create the art for their games.

After a few thinking iterations the concept had earned a place on my to-do list. The astonishment was big, as one could imagine, when I was reading [an article](http://indiegames.com/2012/07/indie_tools_pyxel_edit.html) today on the internet that described this idea exactly like it was in my head. The subtle detail: this application was already developed and available [in beta phase](http://pyxeledit.com/beta.php). Effortlessly I could remove it from my to-do list.

"Pyxel Edit is a drawing application. You can draw Freeform like in any other graphics program, but you can also draw and place tiles. If you have multiple instances of a tile and edit one, they all update. It still works if some of the instances are flipped or rotated. This is really nice when making tile sets, as you can instantly see how all the tiles work together as you draw them. This feature is inspired by the awesome Pixothello and Cosmigo Pro Motion, but taken one step further."

	- Daniel Kvarfordt, the creator of Pyxel Edit

After testing Pyxel Edit, I was really satisfied with the application. It makes making pixel art really easy. The toolset enables you to work fast and solves all the classic problems, you normally would have in a standard illustration program. By creating this application, Daniel gave 2D Developers a time-saving gift for free. Hopefully we'll see a lot of cool games made with this toolset.

To save myself the embarrassment by not showing my self-made "Pyxel" art. But feel free to try out the beta version for free @ [http://pyxeledit.com](http://pyxeledit.com/). Oh, and an interesting side note: He developed the application in the [Adobe Air API](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/documentation.html), which makes it available both to Mac and Windows, without no extra effort at all.
