_Do you still remember the times when there were Arcade Systems everywhere? These glorious times were a time of joy for everyone who loves video games. Creating my own Arcade System sounds logical, keeping our past in mind. I have this idea already a few years. Since last year, I live in a student house, this makes it even more attractive to create one. It's a great complement for the available living spaces. So let's start planning the creation of my own Arcade System, shall we?_

As a student I don't want to spend too much money on this project. With that in mind, what do we need?

+ Some kind of **cabinet**, this can be a custom design, a classic cabinet or a combination. Some family of mine can create the wood necessary for this job, so for this stage of the project, my only job is to design one and assemble it.

+ A **monitor**, which will probably be a TV. You can also buy the original monitors, but they are no option, due to their ridiculous prices.

+ To be able to play video games we need **controls**. I want to be able to play with 2 players, which means I need to double the order for a lot of controller components.

+ An **old desktop** to run emulators and other nifty software.

+ All kinds of **small electronics components**.

There are are tons of out of the box control systems. The advantage is that they work and easy to use. However, this is not an option due to the higher price. This means that the control system will be the hardest part. You can buy all the components online, for no money at all. This will be one big and happy, electronic, experimental experience.

It would also be fun if you could plug in an external HD. Thanks to this you can use the arcade system to play music, a movie or something else. I also need to be able to connect a keyboard and mice very fast, so with all these things in mind, I'll probably place a **USB hub** connected to the desktop.

So yes, I'm going to create an Arcade System, but it will take some time.  I'll buy the different components in the following weeks. During this â€˜waiting' time I'll design the arcade System. In the next post in this series I'll talk about the design process of the arcade system. I will also talk about the implementation of the different electronic components.
