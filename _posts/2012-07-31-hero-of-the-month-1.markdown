_Charles Babbage, the father of the computer and our first hero of the month. This series will be devoted to people who did something heroic related to computer science. As the creator of the first computer, he's more than qualified enough to open this series. Now than, can I please have your full attention for this genius, yet rusty man._

If you [google](http://www.google.com/) this honorable man, you'll find tons of websites providing information about  him, his life and his work. The most obvious resource is [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage). For people who don’t have the time to read trough several websites, books or even just Wikipedia I'll give a short summary about Mr. Babbage and his computer.

Charles Babbage (born on the 26th December 1791) was obsessed with mathematics and earned an honorary degree without examination at [Peterhouse, Cambridge](http://www.pet.cam.ac.uk/), in 1814. The idea to build a 'machinery' which could compute mathematical instructions, was something he has already come up with in 1812. Back then he got inspired by the eighty "human" computers who applied mass production to arithmetic for the first time. The French government used these to produce tables of [logarithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm) at a rate, faster than humanly possible.

As a _classic_ nerd, a lot of his ideas only existed on paper. And so was his last engine, which he came up with somewhere between his creation of the [Difference Engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine) in 1837 and his death in 1871. This engine, the Analytical Engine, was more complex than its successor. It could not only tabulate [polynomial functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial), on top of that it could be programmed using [punched cards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card). These cards enabled users of this machine to design and use custom programs. Who had thought that this concept would still be used for the first wave of [electronic computers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer), starting in 1940. This last engine was therefore the first real computer and was able to compute everything related to numbers. In fact it could do anything a modern computer can today, only way slower.

Oh and one last note, there is one big conceptual difference between this first computer and the modern computers used today. The '[Analytical Engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine)' used the ordinary system, often called the decimal numeral system. This in contradiction with your modern computer which uses the binary numeral system. The reason for that and many other interesting facts you should know about this man and his work, can be found in the following video. Here, [John Graham-Cumming](http://www.jgc.org/) will tell you more about the greatest machine that never was:

Given this short, 12 minute video I'll wrap up this blog post. I hope you enjoyed our first hero of the month. Don’t be shy to share your thoughts about this great man, or additional important resources.
