I'm now almost 4 weeks in he UK. Looking back at those 4 weeks I can definitly say that I've made the right choice. Living here is peacefull and the city is beautifull. That has it's price though, as it certainly isn't the cheapest place to live. Just came back from the cinema for example, which costed me 16 pounds for a ticket and some popcorn.

I moved here for a new job, a new oppertunity. I'm proud to work for Exient and happy that I joined them. Everyday I come to work with a smile, to work with people I respect, with people that make me cheerfull. It's lovely to be among other people who share the same passion, and turn developing games into a craft. It was a choice, and it was the right one.

Still working on my website, slowly but steady. There is no hurry as no one is really waiting for this new website anyhow. It's going to be nice to finally have a website that suits my needs on a system that allows me to experiment and learn. It's nice to be able to write articles in sublime. And soon I'll be able to publish them with the simplicity of my beloved terminal.
