**A few days ago, Olivier, a teacher of mine and great programmer, gave me a great insight. While I was showing him the progress on a team project I'm working on for school I mentioned him about a basic editor I was planning to create for it. It seemed reasonable, as I needed something to create 3D maps very quickly to a text file so that I could use it in this 3D game. Hearing this, he was wondering why I wouldn't just use the same 2D Map creating package as I used for the prototype.**

This got me thinking. As a developer you hate writing code that already exist or develop concepts over and over again. That's one of the reasons why we use libraries and frameworks. So why is it, that I'm planning on creating an Editor while i could just use an existing free tool. It's all about being creative. Just like they use safe-proven medicine for reasons, totally different from when they were researching them, you should use software in every possible way you can.

An example how I used [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/), the 2D tile map editor to create a level for my 2.5D game.

In trying to find software or a framework you could use for your project, you may find only solutions that would do the job, if only it was slightly different. Opensource software is the key word in this story. You can only abuse the content available in a package, so have fun and fill the missing holes with some hot code. And of-course, don't forget to share it with its community!
