The last couple of months I've been doing quite a lot of bigger, and especially more high level projects. Which is why I want to concentrate more on low/native development and improve my knowledge on a couple of topics. To optimise my little spare time I have, I'll therefore only do a small prototype or project at a time.

Almost a year ago, I made Pus Pus Platypus, one of my first fun Oculus Rift Games. It was made on a game jam, where another team had made a small game in asm for the NES platform. I was quite intrigued by this as I had never thought that it would be possible to make an asm game in a time frame as small as 48h. Later, the programmer gave me some URLs that could help me in achieving the same.

Here are they for all who's interested:

+ [Beginner tutorials about programming for NES](http://www.nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&threadid=7155)
+ [Programming Resources](http://www.nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&threadid=33287)
+ [Tools for creating/modifying NES Games](http://www.nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&threadid=32737)

Not sure yet what I'll be making or where I'm going with this, but I do know that this is the first thing I'll be concentrating on as a fun ice breaker.
