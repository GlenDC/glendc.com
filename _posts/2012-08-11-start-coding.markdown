While I was working on my WIN32 Framework I was realising something. Learning is more than just reading. Altought it is true that you have to read a lot to get a lot of knowledge. It isn’t the only thing you need to do. Besides reading you should use that knowledge to develop something, small or big, it doesn’t matter. When you read books as a medium of self-education, you have to know something.

There are 2 different types of books. Yeah there are more, but let’s keep it at two for the sake of simplicity. The first and most important type is the books which are made to read. You buy the book, open it and read it. You should slowly read it and understand everything they are trying to explain. Learn to read in-between the lines as well. [The C++ In-Depth Series](http://www.amazon.com/In-Depth-Box-Set-Bjarne-Stroustrup/dp/0201775816) are a really good example of these kind of books. They are really fun to read and you don’t have to do anything besides reading. If you are a C++ programmer, these are really must to read books.

Be aware that you are not going to be a great programmer, just by reading lecture. You should write a lot of lines of code, really a lot. Try do develop small applications. That’s why we have the second  type of books, the reference guides. API manuals aren’t in general really self-explorantary. The reference books will help you, by explaining everything, bit by bit, in detail. However, please don’t make the mistake by reading these books just like any other book. You shouldn’t read these books page per page. It’s boring and it’s impossible to remember all these details. Just know that these reference guides exist. Have them on your bookshelf, on your e-book reader or just on your computer. Open them when you need them and learn to use the index, it’s your friend!

Just try to remember that you can’t remember everything, doesn’t learn everything by hard. Know that certain things exist and know how they work and how you can use it. Learn to bookmark the manuals and use them when you need it. Have fun with your self-education, I’m going to write some more lines of code.

Cheers!
