'**Hello world**', the default for your first _WordPress 3.0_ blog. However for me and many other programmers this short sentence has a special meaning. Whenever I'm writing this sentence it means that I'm learning a new computer language in one way or another. Thatâ€™s why I'll always embrace these joyful words as an old and wise friend.

However, the motivation for writing it today isn't because I'm learning a new computer language. Rather it is to celebrate the beginning of a new phase in my life. The beginning of a a life dedicated to computer science and shared with the world wide web. Yes, that also includes you. As a loyal reader of this blog you can expect 2 to 3 posts every week.
