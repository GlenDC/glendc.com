While reading a book, on my way to London an idea struck my head. It came to me while I had the sudden desire to play _FEZ_, but didn't had my game pad with me to do it the proper way. A few months back I had the idea, and actually planned it, but never did, to develop a framework and technology around it.

[Portal Gaming](https://github.com/PortalGaming/AirPhoneLib) was all about using your phone as a fourth dimension in gaming. Gaming is becoming casual and "everyone" has a smart phone. Combining the 2 seems only logical. That idea originally started on a hackathon in Antwerp where I developed the infamous "[Pee Game](https://github.com/GlenDC/PeeGame)" with some friendly guys I met there. In short the project allowed you via WebGL technology, to connect to a local website with your smart phone and use it to pee together with your friends on a "big" screen. It worked and it was wonderfully, yet disgusting, or so I'm said.

In the end the follow-up project, Portal Gaming, became yet another project not to realise. Funny enough, months later, I learnt from a good friend in Brussels, that he met an American in Tokyo who had the exact same idea, only he actually executed it. Playing an outdated version was rather disappointing as it didn't worked really well, but than again it was an outdated version. With this guy having executed and succeeded in the idea I had as well, there was absolutely _no point_ in trying to do it myself in the near future.

One branch of the _PG_ project was to allow developers to have a kind of controller on your mobile device that can be used to play a game on your PC. And it is that exact part of the project that suddenly struck me today, on my way to London, while reading a book.

> What if I allowed people to simple install a driver/program that allows you to emulate a game pad such as the Xbox360 controller to play games on your computer, providing them with everything they need, including the driver.

It would definitely have solved my problem of not having a game pad to play _FEZ_ with.
