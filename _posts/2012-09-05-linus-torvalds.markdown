_It's another month, which means a new hero of the month. Last month we had Charles Babbage at the beginning of our computer science history. September is the 9th month of the year, which brings us to the modern history of computer science. It was in 1991, a year before I was born, that Linus Tovalds created a new operating system kernel. This achievement and his work beyond this time gives him a well deserved spot in the Hero of the Month series._

He is a well known and respected figure in the world of computer science. It's great to hear him say he invented Linux just for “fun” as a graduate student. If you don't know him you can maybe fill your knowledge gap by reading a summary at his Wikipedia [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Linux). He is really one of the guys that really inspire me. Reading his story, hear him talk, it's too great to describe in words. That's why I share one of his lectures, you can view it in the included video below. If you want to know more about him you can also find his book via [Google Books](http://books.google.be/books/about/Just_for_Fun.html?id=DcipQgAACAAJ&redir_esc=). I salute this great man, he is a true hero in my eyes.
