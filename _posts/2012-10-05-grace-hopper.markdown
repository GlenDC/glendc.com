_It's Friday. No, we're not getting down. Even more importantly, it's October. A new month, means a new hero of the month. Grace Hopper is the Hero of October and she's also the first female hero in this series. A lot of you don't know who she is or what she did. However, you really should know her. Computer Science today, wouldn't be the same without her. So who is she?_

**Grace Hopper** was in the first place a mathematician, raised in a family connected to the United States Navy. Due to this history it's quite normal that she's also a Naval Officer. To keep a long story short, she invented **the first compiler**. This was in 1952, a period in which people still believed computers only could do arithmetic. Due to her invention I always have to think about here when I read about debugging. It's thanks to her that we don't have to write assembly code anymore and it's thanks to her that we can program so fast these days without any errors. You can read her full story on [this website devoted to her](http://gracehopper.org/2012/) or on [her own Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper). The article on [this website](http://www.sdsc.edu/ScienceWomen/hopper.html) tells you basically the same information but in another context.

To end this short article I would like to show you this video about her, explaining what a nanosecond really is. It changed my view on micro optimization a bit. Enjoy and don't forget to celebrate her this month and think about her when you press that beautiful compiler button.
