_Creating a game on your own, is quite impossible. Cancel the time factor out and you still have to multitask between making art, designing content and programming the source code. This being said, it's fair to say that there aren't many people who have the skill set to make this fairy tale happen. However, the creation of an (indie) game goes beyond the scope of developing software. You have to count in the human part as well, where you have to bring people closer together to join them together as a team, and more than that: a family._

This blog post is all about giving advice on how to create a game as a team. Next week I'll talk about the development process itself. Please, keep in mind that this is only a small guide based on my own experience as a student. The advice, tips and resources I'll give will be based on my own mistakes and experiences. Now then, Let's start, shall we?

Last September I created my own team. The goal was simple to say, yet hard to achieve. Due to several mistakes we've decided to freeze this big project a week ago (temporarily?). These 9 months gave me quite a lot to think about. First of all, never forget the ugly **Time Factor**. Due to this little monster there are 2 things you can do, regarding the type of game you wish to create:

1. You could make a simple and small game, which is fun to play. This type of game depends heavily on its modularity and small amount of mechanics. The story won't play an important role in this sort of game. This first choice gives you still a lot of time to do beside this project.

2. He other type of game, is one which consumes almost all your time. If you and your team members can't spend at least 50% of your life on this project, I would kindly suggest to go for the first type of game. The size of this second type of game can be compared to indie games like Brad and Meatboy. The development of this type of game is not only about creating a fun game to play, it's also about lot's of content. On top of this you’ll have to create a really good (back) story and give it a key role in your game.

My team, and I, tried to create a game based on the 2nd type of game. This was a mistake, as we all had other things on our minds. This includes school, (girl) friends, private projects and self education. At the end, your motivation doesn’t make a difference. The ugly time monster will smack you like a little bitch for making the wrong decisions, please remember this.

Hmm, now that I think about it. There is one thing you should do before you choose your game type of choice. First of all, you should try to **find people**. This is something which could be executed really fast. Which is often is the devil of your 'team' project. The goal is to make a game as one, as a team. Now, a team is not a group of people. It’s a group of people who work together, communicate using all kinds of channels. All team members should know each other really well. What are the weaknesses, what are the strengths? These are all things you should know from every team member, including yourself. Be open about everything related to this project and communicate about every brainsparkle you could possible have.

The human factor of team projects is a tricky one. The problems won’t be obvious and clear like they often are in the development stage. Frustrations will come, and these will all find their roots in small details. As a leader it’s important to spot these problems and solve them. However, as a normal team member you also have the responsibility to communicate. It’s easy to cut down roots, but have you ever tried to wipe out an entire forest with a potato knife?

With these words I’ll end this first part. Next week i‘ll end this series by talking about the development stage of your game and how to communicate propperly. As always, do not hesitate to [mail me](mailto:{{ site.email }}) with questions and suggestions.
