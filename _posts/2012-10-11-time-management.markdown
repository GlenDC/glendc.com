_At the time of writing, it is the third week of my second year at HOWEST (DAE). It's a good habit to reflect your time management regularly. The faster you spot flaws the more productive you'll be. That's exactly what I HAD to do. Due to a big new secret project, I screwed up my time management. So what have I learned from these reflections?_ 

**Enterainment is good, too much isn't**. I love to watch certain series, although I have some bad habits related to it. I tend to watch to many episodes at once. This results in a lot of wasted time if you know that the average time of an episode is somewhere between 30 and 35 minutes. So try to limit yourself to a maximum of 1 episode a day.

**Staring minds don't solve problems**. Some problems are complex by origin. You all know these problems. You had too much caffeine, a lack of sleep and have been stuck at the same problem for hours. My advice, suspend the search for a solution. Give your mind a short 15 minute break and jump onto another project. When you think you're ready for it, atleast a few hours later, go back to the first problem. By doing this you'll have another view of the problem. You will see the solutions you would have never seen before. Or maybe you got an idea while working on that other project. It's also important that you try to think of nothing during that 15-minute break. It's hard, but try to focus on NOTHING.

**Know your priorities**. If you don't know what's important, you'll make a lot of mistakes in your time management. I'll use my current situation as an example for this one. My projects for my coursers at College have the highest priroritie, as this is the foundation of my Game Dev future. Because of deadlines within the team, I have also a high level priority for the new secret big project. My engine comes behind this. Selfeduction is related to all 3 levels, so this has no priority level, but will be done naturally.

**Don't try to build Rome in one day**. It feels good to start a small assignment or mini project and finish it in one breath. Don't, it's just an illusion. Try to spread projects over different sessions. This tip is related to the second one. Really small assignments or sub projects are an excpection on this tip.

**Be human, you have rights**. Try to stay healty. Sleep enough, not to much. (3 to 5 hours is enough if you have power naps  on certain days). Don't forget to eat enough and have enough variation in your food. The reasons for this are obvious so don't forget it.

**Salvation is power**. Get everything out of your system at least 2 times a day. This keeps your focus level on the highest level as possible. Don't overdo it by doing it more than 2 times a day. You can achieve this via a lot of different ways, and this is very personal. Most people do this by running or another sport. Mastrubration or sex works as well.

That was it, I hope you learned something from my reflections. I know, some tips sound obvious. But I've said it before and I'll repeat myself now: "**Knowing something isn't the same as doing something.**" Good luck with your time management!
