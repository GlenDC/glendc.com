In January it will be my first year in the Game Industry, probably one of many. It made me realise that while you have less time for self education and private projects, you also have more time for it. It's a paradox and it's one, like in many things in life, about choices.

The recent hackathons have made me realise that if I want to have a serious change on winning any of these, I'll have to be more fluent in web technology. Databases _(not sure yet which type I prefer)_, Clojurescript, Node and AngularJS are the technologies I'll be focusing most in. Together with web technology I'll also have to be more skillful in networking, sockets and security as it's something not to be underestimated in future projects.

The bigger challenge however, will be about C/C++, better debugging and asm knowledge. Having a better insight in computer architecture and the difference in cpu's and gpu's wouldn't hurt either. As it is very practical in my day-to-day tasks it will be my first main goal. The companion goal will be more about Mathematical thinking, getter a better mindset and practising mathematical principles as much as possible. Graphics programming and the history of that branch is something I definitely need to focus on at some point, but that will be for much later, probably somewhere in Q1 of 2015.

This challenge will be accomplished by reading, doing educational exercises and be serious about MOOC's. Another part is mini projects such as making a (small) NES game (which is probably my main project at this moment). So there is a lot of learning, and only a small project, which feels like the correct approach for now.
