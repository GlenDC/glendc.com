Buying a kindle paperwhite was probably one of the better decisions of my life. Reading becomes much more attractive, and feels natural again. It's feels just as good as these sleepless nights that I had often when being a child. You might know them, if not, sad for you as they are awesome. Having a kindle you can also get some payed extra services that allow you to read a lot of books available on amazon for free (as long as you pay your monthly fee).

> The go-gamedev experiment will consist of the development of an Arkanoid clone using SMFL technology.

The price is fair as long as you read enough, just like most subscriptions. Using the trial versions of a couple of them, I bumped into a funny book, ["The Power of the Pussy, ..."](http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Pussy-Commitment-Relationship-ebook/dp/B0085YBTEO), and no, don't think again, the book is exactly about what you were thinking spontaneously. Even though the book is clearly aimed at woman, it's still a good and fun read. Before I started reading that book, I started planning on how I want to handle my go-gamedev experiment.

As I want to do this experiment as simple as possible, while still proving that an "actual" game project is possible using existing C/C++ technology, I decided to make an Arkanoid game with SMFL. That game also allows me to proof that you can start combining it with Go web-technology and plug multiplayer into it. I don't know all the details yet, but it sounds solid enough. Just need to make sure I can find all the needed legal art assets, as that certainly isn't something I want to spend time on this time.
