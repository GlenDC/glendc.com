Since 2012 I was running my website via _Wordpress_. It's a nice and easy-to-use CMS. Having said that, I realized it was overkill and heavy. I love miniamlistic software, with arch being a nice example of how miniamlistic an OS can be.

After doing some googling and research, I decided to go for the _Jekyll_ approach. A nice, simple and clean static web generator, written in _Ruby_. You can find more information about it on [their official homepage](http://jekyllrb.com/). The documentation is wonderfull and finding a theme to bootstrap yourself is rather easy too. Two hours later and I'm running the first draft version of my website, which brings me to the next step: deployment.

While I learned to work with Jekyll, I discovered that you can hook your website source on a server to automate the whole deployment process. The only problem was that my host only supported web hosting. What I needed was a [_Virtual Private Server_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server) (VPS). Having zero server admin experience, it promises to be one steep learning curve. At least I can manage it with [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/)!
