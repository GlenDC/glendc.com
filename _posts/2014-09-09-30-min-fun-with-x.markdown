It has been quite a journey, but my website is as good as finished. All pages are implemented and validated and my GitHub projects gets feed via the GitHub octokit API. Also made sure that the design is reponsive.

Once my mobile header navigation is implemented I can put the entire site online and make sure that my VPS is setup correctly.

Since today I also started a new self-development concept. 2 to 3 times per week, I spent 30 minutes on my Mac OS X at the office learning either Rust, Unreal Engine 4 or Swift. Therefore I call it "30 minutes fun with X". Might not seem like a lot of time, but I'm sure that it will deliver results in the future.
