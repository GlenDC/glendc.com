The last couple of days I was starting to feel really tense. Today I decided to do something about it. I knew from the past that going to the gym both helps me to loosen up and to keep in shape. Moving to a new country, also means finding a new gym and a place where I can come to peace with mind and body.

Via some colleagues I found out about the [Pure Health Club](http://www.purehealthclub.com/). Today I went for the first time, and I am totally impressed by it. Being able to use a swimming pool, jacuzzi, steam room and sauna on top of your typical gym work out or group session is amazing. After a day of work, especially in busy periods as these, this is what I defenitly can use and need.

I can guarantee you this, the pure health club has a new very regular member.
