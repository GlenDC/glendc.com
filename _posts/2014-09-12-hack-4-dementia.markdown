Another weekend, another hackathon! This weekend I'll head over to London to participate in [the DementiaHack event](http://hackernest.com/dementiahack/). I have no clue what to expect, but I'm sure it will be fun and will share more about it this weekend.

> DementiaHack is an international hackathon produced by the British Consulate-General Toronto and HackerNest that brings together the brightest minds in dementia management, patient care, and healthcare technology to tackle the most pressing challenges faced by caregivers and people with dementia.

Also, my new website is up and running. And equally importantly, my mail is working again as well. I'm very Happy about this and decided to celebrate it with some good Sushi this weekend in London, after all this web-nonsense I deserve it!
