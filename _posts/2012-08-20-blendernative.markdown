_Blender, a great example of open source software. A powerful 3D application and a great free alternative for Maya or 3DSmax. I've learned my 3D skills myself via Blender a few years ago. On top of this skill set I also learned how to program in Python, which is quite useful in some situations. Lately I've been getting a lot of questions of friends (of friends) about Blender and how to learn it. Because of all these requests I decided to write a little blog post about Blender, so that this page can be used to spread the word. I'm not going to write too much about the core of blender or its history. I'm just going to talk about where you can find everything so your Blender journey can begin._

[Blender.org](http://blender.org/) is the main website of blender. Here you can find examples of work in blender, references to different kind of websites, information about the application, manuals of the different versions of blender, blender installers and the e-shop.

In the e-shop you can buy goodies, training dvd's and books. Be careful when you buy an item of these last 2 categories. Blender evolves really quickly, just like everything in computer science. So I would suggest to use the things that you buy immediately. Also try to always buy your items for the latest major release of blender. Which is at the moment of writing Blender 2.6.x. There are also enough free tutorials which you can find easily via our friend. Most of the websites you probably know already with [cg tuts+](http://cg.tutsplus.com/) as THE example.

**The blender Community** made Blender big. Thanks to them Blender is what it is today. The biggest English Blender forum is [Blender Artists](http://www.blenderartists.org/forum/). A great Blog website about blender is [Blender Nation](http://www.blendernation.com/), which helps you to keep up to date. We live in a time where instant communication is possible with chat protocols such as IRC. So if you want instant replies to your questions you should use IRC. The different Blender channels can be found at the [FreeNode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenode) server, which was founded in 1995. There are a lot of Blender channels but the most important ones are listed [here](http://www.blender.org/community/chat/). If you don't have an IRC client you can just use [a web chat client](http://webchat.freenode.net/). On this server you can also find my personal channel #GlenDC and a lot of Linux channels.

**Blender is Open Source** which makes it completely free. But that's not all, you can also edit the original source code and create your custom Blender version based on the official releases of Blender or Custom versions by the Blender Community. To keep track of all the different Blender versions and releases you can make use of the unofficial library: [GraphicAll](http://graphicall.org/).

That's about if for my short article about Blender. If you're confused about something than you can always mail me. You can also chat with me via my IRC channel or you could just leave a message via the Facebook plugin below. Don't forget to spread the word about blender by liking this post.
