It's Sunday, I slept quite a lot and had an amazing breakfast. A combination you certainly wouldn't expect at a hackathon. #Dementiahack 2014 in London is by far one of the best catered hackathon-like events that I have ever been too. While people in _Toronto_ went to bed, people here in London woke up, the beauty about 2 events across the world connected with cameras and a _Google Hangout_.

Looking quite forward to watch the presentations of all the different teams in about 6 hours. With everyone developing applications to nullify dementia, there will probably be at least a couple of applications which will actually get used in the real world and make this world a better place. And that, is much more rewarding than any price in the world.

I however have given up as I was tired of the personal struggles with web development. Did it the last 9 months a little to much and it's getting on my nerves. It certainly doesn't feel good anymore to work with all this web technology. Enough is enough for a while...
