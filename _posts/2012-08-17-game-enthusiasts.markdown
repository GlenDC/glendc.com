Yesterday I didn't write a single line of code. The reason: Gamescom 2012 in Cologne. Thanks to my university college I got the change with several others to go to this magnificent event for free. I'm really grateful for it and it also made me remember something really important.

"Gamescom is the World's largest games event with 275,000 visitors from 39 countries attending the show in its third year." â€“ Wikipedia

I've been busy with the development of games the past year. And I must say, you sometimes tend to forget why you're working day and night. Yesterday at Gamescom I remembered again, why I'm spending every single spare moment behind my desk. It's because of the gamers. It's madness how all these gamers wait for more than an hour to play a game for 10 minutes. It's just a small example of how much love these gamers have for their favourite games.

You can't describe the feeling. The feeling you get when someone enjoys every single second of your game. It's amazing, the connection between you and the player with the game in between. It's for them that you write all those flashy lines of codes in the dark. Game enthusiasts are a true motivation and the reason why I love making games.
