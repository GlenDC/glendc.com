Now that my website is built with Jekyll, my experience with my blog has improved a lot. The normal proxies is to work on my website locally and push my changes, when done, to GitHub. My VPS will pull these changes on a regular basis and thus recompile them when these exist.

The local part could be cut out, as GitHub provides file modification right from your browser. Which means that in case your website source is stored on GitHub, that you could use the website also as a CMS, by just editing the files straight from the browser. Which is what I needed today, to make some simple fixes to my HTML and css during my lunch break. As I had no personal computer with me, it was the only option and effectively a nice one.

GitHub, what a magnificent service.
