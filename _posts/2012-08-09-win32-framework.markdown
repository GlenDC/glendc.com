_I was planning on writing this blog post yesterday. That was until I got really sick. After a 14 Hour battle, I think I've won, although I'm not sure of that at all. The last couple of weeks I've done a lot of reading and research. And I will continue researching things, the next couple of weeks for some big future projects._

Besides all this research, I am going to start writing my own framework based on the Win32 API in the next couple of days. It's also gives me the chance to practice some stuff I've learned this summer. This framework will give me the power to create an empty windows application in just a few minutes. Thanks to this I can invest all my time into the application itself. The framework will also include a Library of scripts I'm working on.

I'll use this framework for projects related to university and some private projects. In the future I'll have another framework for my multiplatform applications, but for now the Win32 framework will do. In this series I'll share you the progress of this framework. If I bump into special problems, I'll share them with some solutions. It will feel good, doing some scripting myself again, rather than reading 24/7 about it. If you're curious about something you've seen in my screenshots or posts in general. And you're asking yourself, “How did he do this?”. Just ask me via a comment below, IRC chat or mail. I'll include these questions plus the answers via the next blog post in this series.

That's it for now.
Cheers!
