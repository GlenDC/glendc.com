  The game is fully written on top of XNA, 
  and will be released for Windows 8, Windows Phone 
  in the near future.There is a fully functional 
  world editor which will be available to the users 
  for editing and releasing maps. 
  Target audience is people from 15 to 30. 
  In the game we are create awareness about 
  the current state of the usage of energy sources. 
  By implementing either a negative or 
  a positive effect to the playerâ€™s choices. 
  Thanks to the world editor, 
  a community will be able to create and 
  share their own interpretation to the world. 
  For this was also an engine written 
  which will be released in the near future.
