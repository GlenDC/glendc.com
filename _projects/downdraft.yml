  The game is fully build with a custom framework fully&nbsp;
  written on top of XNA 4.0, and can only be played on the&nbsp;
  Windows 7 platform.This was a choice due to the very short&nbsp;
  deadlines and having a lot of other projects on that time as well.&nbsp;
  As a corporate spy you have to use the power of the wind to propel&nbsp;
  yourself over dangerous gaps and traps to escape the deadly factory with&nbsp;
  your stolen plans. It's a skill based game intended for hardcore Gamers.&nbsp;
  User should be aware that there is a subtle amount of violence in the game.&nbsp;
