  Pus Pus Platypus is a game made in Unity for the Indie Speed Run 2013.&nbsp;
  I Particpated in it on a local event during my Erasmus on the University&nbsp;
  of Applied Sciences in Kajaani. It was the first game I ever made with&nbsp;
  the Occulus Rift. Using this technology was quite exciting and so&nbsp;
  I hope that you can test the game with an Occulus Rift.&nbsp;

      A deceivingly delightful game where you blow kisses at&nbsp;
      enemies rather than bullets. I was initially perplexed by&nbsp;
      this game and then the charm of it overcame me and&nbsp;
      I played it over and over trying to blow kisses&nbsp;
      to everything/everyone I saw.
