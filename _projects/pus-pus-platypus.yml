  Pus Pus Platypus is a game made in Unity for the Indie Speed Run 2013. I Particpated in it on a local event during my Erasmus on the University of Applied Sciences in Kajaani. It was the first game I ever made with the Occulus Rift. Using this technology was quite exciting and so I hope that you can test the game with an Occulus Rift.

    quote: A deceivingly delightful game where you blow kisses at enemies rather than bullets. I was initially perplexed by this game and then the charm of it overcame me and I played it over and over trying to blow kisses to everything/everyone I saw.
